Machine learning is now being used widely in several areas of science and engineering including
Geosciences. It is also well recognized that for a successful application of ML, domain
knowledge is necessary. At the same time, geoscientists must understand the fundamental
concepts and limitations of different ML algorithms for meaningful applications. The course
lectures will describe the basic concepts in a simple manner using many realistic examples and is
aimed at junior/senior undergrad students and entry level graduate students. We will provide hands on exercises at each step to
recognize the importance of the ML techniques. Computer software and data will be provided.

No prior programming experience is necessary.
